<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I recently found out about web development and try learning it. I fell in love with it right away and has been trying
  to learn everyday.
</p>

<p>Somedays there are no time to learn web dev, but whenever there is freetime, I try to learn as much as I can.
  Some part are harder than others but I'm not giving up
</p>

<p>I'm hoping that I will love web dev even more and would also like to get a job in web dev so that I can code everyday,
  because it's fun.
